# tank_game
This is a game, the objective is to learn how to use objects and pygame, this will be my first 'game_dev' repo. I will be using python and this will be my second last 'big' python project.
With this game the objeective is to have a clean looking playable game that others can play with their friends(using a local host/server), I find this the most challenging project yet.
